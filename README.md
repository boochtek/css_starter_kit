CSS Starter Kit
===============

CSS Starter Kit is a simple set of CSS to start projects with.
The main idea here is for the CSS to be simple and easy to use.
More importantly, we fully believe in semantic HTML.
So we'll never make you put a `button` class on a `button` element.
Hopefully this will make it easier to use than all the CSS frameworks.

There's no JavaScript included.
We believe that appearance and behavior and should generally be kept separate.
We will use JavaScript (and NPM) to handle dependencies, and to manage the build process.
(Actually there's a tiny bit of JavaScript.
We use it to support HTML 5 in older IE, and to add `js` or `no-js` classes to the HTML element.)

This project came about due to my displeasure with all the existing CSS frameworks.
None of them seem to be simple to use.
They all seem to require non-semantic HTML markup.
That's not how HTML should work.
I also wanted some simple HTML to use as an example showing everything off.
